# Write a program that receives a number of seconds from
# a user and counts down this amount of seconds in
# resolution of 0.1 second by printing the amount of time left.
# For example, if the user inserts 3, your program should constantly print:
# 3 seconds left
# 2.9 seconds left
# 2.8 seconds left
# 2.7 seconds left
# â€¦.
# 0.1 seconds left
# DONE!
